Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your milestones'
content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required
for the milestones that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to
sign off on your milestones each week (before the deadline); typically you
should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.


# Milestone 1

## Probable Ideas for the Project

List of ideas being considered:

- NodeJS Packages Analyser
  - Provide link to a public github repo
  - Program looks at the code and package.json file to find:
    - Packages unused in actual code.
    - List of packages with known vulnerabilities
    - Total size of the program when all packages/dependencies are installed.
    - Displays the hierarchy of dependencies/packages (diagram).


- JavaScript/NodeJS Functional Program Visualizer
  - Provide a link to a public github repo.
  - Get a UML-Like diagram showing the relationships between different modules/functions in the code.
    - Or on TS/Python if we want to work with OOP instead.
  - Easily identify redundant code in large projects.

- JavaScript - Programmer‚Äôs Frustration Analyser üòÇ
  - For programmers frustrated by job interviews
  - Given a Github repo
  - Looks at and visualises:
    - How many times did engineers have to invert a binary tree?
    - How many times did they reverse a linkedList?
    - Did anyone talk about BigO notation in the comments?
    - etc...

- Memory leak/code vulnerability analyzer? (e.g. Valgrind on C++/C, but much simpler, or maybe with other language -- security/vulnerabilities)
  - If there are existing packages, we can use them to get stats on these info then do visualization

### Other Ideas that can be looked into further:
- General ideas on (static) program analyzer + visualization:
    - Performance of different APIs/features for that program
    - Unused imports, variables, etc. + visualization on how many of them are coming from each file in the program
    - Code style consistency between files in a program (e.g. indentation level, type of comment--e.g. Line comments vs block of comments)

## To-do
- Think about a few more ideas
- Bring ideas to the the TA on tuesday
- Finalize an idea for milestone 2


# Milestone 2

## Description of Idea
- JavaScript Functional Program Visualizer
  - User provides a link to a public Github repository. 
  - The program generates a visualization showing the relationships between different modules in the code (that is written in a functional fashion).
  - Between modules (that are not third-party) in the code, the visualization will also show which functions are used, and provide their call graph.
  - The purpose of the program is to help identify redundant code in large projects and aid in making refactoring decisions.

## TA Feedback
- All ideas except for #2 are either not valid or too complicated for this project
- For #2 it's important to be accurate when checking which calls are going where, for example be careful of multiple functions of the same name (overriding, overloading)

## Responsibilities 
- Everyone
  - Attend weekly meetings, monday + thursday
- David
  - Milestone submissions
  - Engine
- Dhruv
  - Visualizer
  - Arrange 1-2 user(s) for the final user study.
- Howard
  - Video
  - Fetching Service (or Upload)
- Michelle
  - Engine
  - Arrange 1 user for the first user study

## Roadmap
- Research - By Monday, Nov 7
  - Import/export syntax possibilities in Javascript based on specs provided by W3C and Linux Foundation.
  - Identify appropriate libraries for AST parsing
    - acorn?--AST looks ‚Äúclean‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt seem to support parsing of ‚Äúimport‚Äù statements according to astexplorer.net
    - typescript--more detailed info from the AST, may contain more unnecessary data in the AST, but can support parsing for pretty much any type of JS code.
    - flow--type inference
  - Identify appropriate format and mechanism for generating the visualisation graph.
  - Identify mechanism to fetch and read source code from Github.
- First User study
  - Modify the design based on the first user study
- Implementation
  - Fetching Service (Or only upload?)
    - Downloads source code from provided Github repository (only .js files?)
  - Engine
    - Checks the package.json file to determine third-party packages?
    - Iterates through the source tree of JS files, parses them and identifies the relationships between each of the modules and their functions. 
  - Visualizer (https://modeling-languages.com/javascript-drawing-libraries-diagrams/)
    - Displays visual representation of the relationships in the parsed JS code

## Notes on first user study

<b>User (JavaScript Developer)</b>: Look the wireframe diagrams provided. Comment on the usefulness of the tool presented and format in which data is presented visually.
<ul> 
  <li>The tool presented is helpful for identifying redundant code, visualising complexity of relationships between modules/functions and making refactoring descisions in case of functional JavaScript code.</li> 
  <li>It could potentially also help in case a new engineer is inducted into a software team as it gives a good visual overview of the project.</li>
  <li>The relationships between modules are presented clearly with the ability to hide nodes from specific directories to declutter the view.</li> 
  <li>The modal view provides a good overview of the relationship between two modules. However, the details section for the rows of the table feel inadequate with only line numbers provided. It would be better if the names of the functions in which the reference is made could also be provided - going to the call graph to get this information feels unnecessary.</li> 
  <li>The call graph is presented in the form of a hierarchy view, which is appropriate for the case. Ability to hide nodes from certain directories in this view as well would be nice.</li> 
</ul>

## Changes to original design

 - Visualization changes were made, we originally intended to have an arrow going from every call to every callee, but this would end up being a lot of arrows. For less clutter we have arrows only between each file with additional information on click.

- Further added a sidebar with the ability to hide the modules contained in a certain directory to help the user navigate the visualization better and reduce visual overload

## Progress so far

- Fetching service - saves js files found on github to our designated folder (done).
- Visualizer - design finalized for the most part (See Mockup), json input sent from engine also mostly finalized.
- Engine - File input and AST generation finished, AST Visitor and JSON output in progress.

# Next Milestone (WIP)

## Status of Implementation

## Final User study plans

<ul>
  <li> Two users would be asked to analyse a Github repository using the tool between 29th-30th November. </li>
  <li> Both users must be familiar with Javascript, basics of functional programming and object-oriented programming. </li>
  <li> Users would be asked to comment on the usefulness and format of the visualization generated by the tool. </li>
</ul>

## Timeline

## Feedback to be addressed
<ul>
  <li>Explore increasing complexity by adding multi-paradigm support i.e. analyse and visualize both functional and oop style components.</li>
  <li>Feedback from Yanze via Discord:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>"@everyone Hi team, I discussed with Alex about your project progress so far. First of all, we both think you are making good progress. But as I told @Dhruv today, the complexity of your current "analysis" part is slightly below the bar.

Specifically, we want you to statically analyze the code which are not "statically deterministic". Since you are generating call-graphs, the best example is method invocation from an object. 

If the concrete type of an object may vary during the execution, possibly due to different branches assign different values to the variable, or there are multiple implementations of the method on the object's inheritance chain. Then you should try to analyze the control flow, and compute a more precise set of targets of a method call.

Since now you have multiple choices at a method invocation, you will also need to think about how do you visualize this on your front end."</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
