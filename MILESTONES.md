Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your milestones'
content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required
for the milestones that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to
sign off on your milestones each week (before the deadline); typically you
should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.


# Milestone 1

## Probable Ideas for the Project

List of ideas being considered:

- NodeJS Packages Analyser
  - Provide link to a public github repo
  - Program looks at the code and package.json file to find:
    - Packages unused in actual code.
    - List of packages with known vulnerabilities
    - Total size of the program when all packages/dependencies are installed.
    - Displays the hierarchy of dependencies/packages (diagram).


- JavaScript/NodeJS Functional Program Visualizer
  - Provide a link to a public github repo.
  - Get a UML-Like diagram showing the relationships between different modules/functions in the code.
    - Or on TS/Python if we want to work with OOP instead.
  - Easily identify redundant code in large projects.

- JavaScript - Programmerâ€™s Frustration Analyser ðŸ˜‚
  - For programmers frustrated by job interviews
  - Given a Github repo
  - Looks at and visualises:
    - How many times did engineers have to invert a binary tree?
    - How many times did they reverse a linkedList?
    - Did anyone talk about BigO notation in the comments?
    - etc...

- Memory leak/code vulnerability analyzer? (e.g. Valgrind on C++/C, but much simpler, or maybe with other language -- security/vulnerabilities)
  - If there are existing packages, we can use them to get stats on these info then do visualization

### Other Ideas that can be looked into further:
- General ideas on (static) program analyzer + visualization:
    - Performance of different APIs/features for that program
    - Unused imports, variables, etc. + visualization on how many of them are coming from each file in the program
    - Code style consistency between files in a program (e.g. indentation level, type of comment--e.g. Line comments vs block of comments)

## To-do
- Think about a few more ideas
- Bring ideas to the the TA on tuesday
- Finalize an idea for milestone 2
